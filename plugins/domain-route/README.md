## Overview

Workloads on Orion are published as a path on the platform host. Domain Route publishes one at a hostname you own instead, with a certificate and an optional DNS record, without changing the workload or its plugin.

It also solves the case the platform has no answer for today: an application a user started inside a Helios or Wetty session. Those templates publish a single port, the desktop or the terminal, so an app listening on port 8000 inside the session is unreachable. A Kubernetes Service is only a label selector, so this plugin creates its own Service against the same pod on whatever port the app uses, and routes a hostname to it.

---

## How It Works

**Plugin / Application** - Installed into a project namespace. One install publishes one hostname. Install it again under a different name for a second hostname.

Two kinds of target:

- **workload** matches the pods of a running workload by label and serves any port they listen on, published or not
- **service** points at a Service that already exists in the project

---

## Prerequisites

- A DNS record for the hostname pointing at the cluster ingress address, or the ExternalDNS plugin installed and `publish_dns` enabled so the record is created for you
- The Certificate Issuer plugin installed, if you want TLS
- The application bound to `0.0.0.0` inside the session, not `127.0.0.1`, or nothing outside the pod can reach it

## Installation

1. Open **Terra** and navigate to the **Plugin Marketplace**
2. Search for **"Domain Route"**
3. Click **Install**
4. Fill in the configuration fields below
5. Click **Confirm** to deploy

## Configuration

### Install-Time Fields

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| `hostname` | **string** · Required<br>Hostname to serve on, for example `app.example.com` |
| `target_kind` | **select** · Required · Default: `workload`<br>`workload` selects pods by label, `service` points at an existing Service |
| `target_name` | **string** · Required<br>Workload instance name, or Service name |
| `target_port` | **int** · Required · Default: `8080`<br>Port the application listens on. For a workload target this does not need to be a published port |
| `selector_label` | **select** · Optional · Default: `juno-innovations.com/workstation`<br>Label the target carries. Helios and the runtime templates use `juno-innovations.com/workstation`, most others use `kuiper.juno-innovations.com/kuiper-instance` |
| `path` | **string** · Required · Default: `/`<br>Path prefix served on the hostname |
| `backend_protocol` | **select** · Required · Default: `HTTP`<br>Protocol the target speaks. Helios serves HTTPS |
| `tls_issuer` | **string** · Optional<br>cert-manager ClusterIssuer name. Leave empty to serve without requesting a certificate |
| `publish_dns` | **boolean** · Required · Default: `false`<br>Annotate the route so ExternalDNS creates the record |
| `ingress_class` | **string** · Required · Default: `nginx`<br>Ingress class to publish through |
| `auth` | **select** · Required · Default: `none`<br>`none` leaves authentication to the application, `basic` puts HTTP basic auth in front |
| `basic_auth_secret` | **string** · Optional<br>htpasswd Secret in this project, used when `auth` is `basic` |
| `rate_limit` | **int** · Optional · Default: `0`<br>Requests per second from a single source address. `0` means no limit |
| `allow_cidrs` | **string** · Optional<br>Comma separated CIDR ranges allowed to reach this route |

## Finding the Target

For a workload target, `target_name` is the workload instance name as shown in Hubble, and `selector_label` is the label that workload's chart puts on its pods. If a route returns 503, the selector matched nothing:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <project> --show-labels
```

Pick whichever of the two labels appears there and set `selector_label` to match.

---

## Authentication

A route on a custom domain cannot use the Hubble session gate. The platform session cookie is scoped to the Orion host and is never sent to another domain, so a subrequest against it would reject every caller. That leaves three honest options, and the plugin makes you choose one:

- the application authenticates its own users, which is the right answer for anything with a login of its own
- `auth: basic`, which is enough to keep a development app off the open internet
- `auth: none` with `allow_cidrs` set, when the caller has a known address range

Create the Secret for basic auth with htpasswd:

```bash
htpasswd -c auth <username>
kubectl create secret generic route-basic-auth --namespace <project> --from-file=auth
```

---

## Notes

- Workloads that carry a NetworkPolicy only admit traffic from the ingress controller namespace. Routes created here arrive from exactly that namespace, so they are permitted, while a proxy running inside the project would not be
- An application serving under a sub-path, which most platform workloads do, will not work at `/` on a custom domain. Either set `path` to the prefix the application expects, or use the workload template's own `hostname` field, which reconfigures the application to serve from the root
- The Service created for a workload target is named after the install, so several routes against the same workload on different ports do not collide
- Deleting the install removes the route and the Service, but not the certificate Secret. Remove that by hand if the hostname is gone for good
- Leave `publish_dns` off when the record already exists, otherwise ExternalDNS and whoever owns the zone are both managing the same name
