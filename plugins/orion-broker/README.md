# Orion Broker (orion-broker)

Workload template plugin that fronts **externally managed infrastructure** with
the Orion connection broker. It creates **NodePort services** that route
external clients to the backend's exposed ports. No workload pod is deployed —
traffic flows straight through to the external backend.

## How It Works

One NodePort service + matching EndpointSlice is generated per entry in the
`ports` list. Each EndpointSlice (with the `kubernetes.io/service-name` label)
points at the backend IP. NodePorts are **auto-assigned** by Kubernetes
(30000–32767).

## Launch Fields

| Field   | Default                                            | Purpose                                                                                        |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ip`    | *required*                                         | IP address of the externally managed backend running the Orion broker (single address for now) |
| `ports` | `[{name: port, service_port: 443, protocol: TCP}]` | Repeatable list of ports to expose from the backend                                            |

Each `ports` entry has:

| Sub-field      | Default | Purpose                                                                                    |
|----------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`         | `port`  | Name of the port — used as the Service port name and in `<workload>-port-<name>` resources |
| `service_port` | `443`   | Port on the backend (also the Service port)                                                |
| `protocol`     | `TCP`   | `TCP` or `UDP`                                                                             |

## Notes

- To change the backend IP, update `ip` at launch time, or patch the
  EndpointSlice resources afterward (the service definitions stay the same).
- `EndpointSlice` (not legacy `Endpoints`) is used — the Endpoints API is
  deprecated since Kubernetes 1.33. IPv4 backends only for now.
