# Advanced

Terra provides several advanced features to enhance the plugin itself. These features allow developers to create more 
complex and powerful plugins that can be used in other ways.

## Metadata ConfigMap

Terra allows you to define a `ConfigMap` that contains metadata about your plugin. This `ConfigMap` can be used to store
additional information about your plugin that can be accessed by other plugins or applications via the Terra REST API. 

To use this feature, you can define the `metadata` field in your `plugins/<plugin name>/templates/metadata.yaml` file:

```yaml linenums="1" title="plugins/deadline10/templates/metadata.yaml"
--8<-- "plugins/deadline10/templates/metadata.yaml"
```

Terra will find the Release Name with postfix `-terra-metadata` and load the data from the `ConfigMap` into the plugin's 
metadata. This allows you to store additional information via the Terra REST API.

## ArgoCD Sync Waves

In Kubernetes, the concept of "dependencies" is really not possible. ArgoCD allows you to define "sync waves" to control
the order in which resources are applied. This allows you to define dependencies between resources and ensure that they are
applied in the correct order. This is done by applying the `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave` annotation to the resources
you want to control the order of. For example:

Sync Wave 1

```yaml linenums="1" title="Setup Directories Job"
--8<-- "plugins/deadline10/templates/wave-1/setup-directories-job.yaml"
```

Sync Wave 2

```yaml linenums="1" title="Download Installer"
--8<-- "plugins/deadline10/templates/wave-2/downloader.yaml"
```

## Terra Packaging

In some cases, it is just easier to write a script that does the installation for you. Terra allows you to "package" a 
"scripts" directory that contains any kind of data you need to run your plugin. For example, you may want to run an 
installation script that downloads a binary or runs a series of commands to set up your plugin and then install an 
image as an icon. This can be done by creating a "scripts" directory in your plugins root directory. Terra will then
take that directory and all of its contents and tar it up and then base64 encode it. This base64 encoded string will be
added to a ConfigMap called `{{ .Release.Name }}-scripts-configmap` and `{{ .Release.Name }}-scripts-configmap-cleanup`.
You can then mount these ConfigMaps in your plugin's templates and use the scripts as needed. Here is an example:

Packaged Script ConfigMap

```yaml linenums="1" title="Packaged Scripts ConfigMap"
--8<-- "plugins/deadline10/templates/packaged-scripts.yaml"
```

Mounted Job

```yaml linenums="1" title="Install Job Example"
--8<-- "plugins/deadline10/templates/wave-2/downloader.yaml"
```

### What `make package` Does

```bash
make package <plugin-name>
```

Internally:

1. `tar --owner=0 --group=0 --mtime='1970-01-01' --sort=name -czf scripts.tar scripts/`
   — creates a deterministic (reproducible) gzip tarball
2. `base64 -w 0 scripts.tar` — encodes as a single-line base64 string
3. Injects the string into `templates/packaged-scripts.yaml` and `templates/packaged-scripts-cleanup.yaml`
4. Runs `make check-size <plugin-name>` to verify the result fits within the 1MiB limit

The two generated files are committed to git and synced by ArgoCD. **Never edit them by hand.**

### Generated vs Source Files

| File | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| `scripts/` | Source — edit this | Edit freely |
| `scripts/chart/` | Source — edit this (workload templates only) | Edit freely |
| `templates/packaged-scripts.yaml` | **Generated** | Never edit; run `make package` |
| `templates/packaged-scripts-cleanup.yaml` | **Generated** | Never edit; run `make package` |

### Verifying All Plugins Are Up To Date

```bash
make verify
```

Scans every plugin with a `scripts/` directory and checks whether any source file in `scripts/` is
newer than the generated `packaged-scripts.yaml` — meaning the plugin has been edited but not yet
repackaged. If any such plugins are found, it prints each plugin name and exits with a non-zero code,
failing the CI run. Runs automatically in CI on every push to `plugins/**`.

### Development: Auto-Repackage on Save

```bash
make watch <plugin-name>
```

Watches `scripts/` for changes and reruns `make package` automatically. Requires `inotifywait`
(available in the devbox shell). Useful when iterating on workload template charts.

!!! danger "Scripts Directory Limitations"
    The scripts directory is not a full-fledged file system. It is a ConfigMap that is mounted as a volume in your plugin's
    templates. This means that you cannot use it to store large files or directories. It is meant for small scripts and
    configuration files that are needed to run your plugin.

!!! danger "Size Limitations"
    The scripts directory is limited to 1MiB in size. This is a hard limit imposed by Kubernetes ConfigMaps. If you need to
    store larger files, you will need to use a different method, such as storing the files in a remote location and downloading
    them during the plugin's installation process.

    `make package` automatically checks size and warns at 900KB / errors at 1MiB.
    You can also check manually: `make check-size <plugin-name>`

!!! danger "Repackage Scripts"
    Every time you make a change to the scripts directory, you will need to run `make package <plugin name>` to update the
    ConfigMap. This will repackage the scripts directory and update the ConfigMap with the new base64 encoded string. You will
    then need to push the changes to the remote branch for ArgoCD to pick up the changes.

### Security Considerations

The scripts directory is a powerful feature that allows you to run custom scripts during the plugin's installation process.
However, it is important to be aware of the security implications of using this feature. The scripts directory is encoded
and essentially obfuscated. When Terra loads your plugin, it will NOT use the pre-packaged scripts that are pre-encoded in the
ConfigMap in the git source code. It will instead repackage the scripts directory and encode it again. This means that
the scripts stored in plain text in the git repository will be guaranteed to be the ones run by Terra. This is done to ensure
that the scripts are always up-to-date and to prevent any potential security issues or malicious code from being executed
during the plugin's installation process.

This is not the case when running locally on your system. When you run `make test-plugin <plugin name>`, ArgoCD will use the 
pre-packaged scripts that are pre-encoded in the ConfigMap in the git source code. This is one of the drawbacks of the development 
workflow. Please exercise caution when using the scripts directory and ensure that you are not introducing any security vulnerabilities 
into your plugin. Always review the scripts you are adding to the directory and ensure they are safe to run in a production environment.
